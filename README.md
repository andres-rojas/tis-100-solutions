# TIS-100 Solutions
This repo is just a way for me to share some of the solutions that I
came up with while playing [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com/)'s
[TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/).

In TIS-100, you're essentially writing assembler instructions for an
imaginary device, so saving / sharing them via source control seemed
natural.

The game is over three years old at this point, so I expect there are
optimal solutions to be found in the usual places on the internet.
Probably many others on Github, or other public repos too.

***I make no claim that these solutions are optimal in any way.***

These solutions are what I came up with as I went through each sequence,
and subsequently tried to either:

- Complete secondary goals / acheivements
- Optimize for cycle / node / instruction counts

If you wandered over here somehow, I'd encourage you to share your own
solutions, and feel free to submit PRs if you'd like to optimize my
solutions.
